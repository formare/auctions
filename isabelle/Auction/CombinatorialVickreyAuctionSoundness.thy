section {* left-total *}

text {* The combinatorial Vickrey auction in relational form is left-total.
  Note that in Isabelle/HOL's logic of total functions, an outcome (allocation @{term x} and
  @{term p}) will always trivially exist, as they are return values of functions.  It is more
  interesting to prove that the outcome of our auction is \emph{well-defined}. *}
