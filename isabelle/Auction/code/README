This is a command-line program that runs best from the directory in
which this README file is located, i.e. the directory into which you
have unzipped the demo archive, or into which you downloaded
individual files from the Auction Theory Toolbox homepage at
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/formare/code/auction-theory/isabelle/Auction/code/.

There are currently the following self-contained demos:

* hard-coded input
  * executable code: CombinatorialVickreyAuctionHardCoded.jar
* CATS (using the bid format of http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~kevinlb/CATS/)
  * sample bid input: example.cats
  * executable code: CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCATS.jar
* CAB (using a variant of the CATS format with bidder IDs)
  * sample bid input: example.cab
  * executable code: CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCAB.jar

The programs accept other input than the sample one too; have a look
into the files to understand the input format.

If you don't have Scala, you need Java as well as scala-library.jar, which you can get from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/scala-tools/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.10.2/scala-library-2.10.2.jar (or any more recent version).

The following instructions apply to the CAB example; please modify accordingly for the other examples.  Those examples that come without input files do not require the "< input-file" part of the command line.  They assume that you do not have Scala.  If you do, replace "java -cp scala-library.jar:..." with "scala -cp ...".

On Unix-like systems (Linux, Mac OS), run the example with:

java -cp scala-library.jar:CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCAB.jar CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCAB < example.cab

On Windows, using the CMD shell, use:

java -cp scala-library.jar;CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCAB.jar CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCAB < example.cab

The path separator (";" instead of ":") is the only difference.

We do not currently know how to get this job done using the Windows
PowerShell; if you do, we'd appreciate if you let us know at
