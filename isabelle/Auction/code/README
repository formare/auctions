This is a command-line program that runs best from the directory in
which this README file is located, i.e. the directory into which you
have unzipped the demo package.

On Unix-like systems (Linux, Mac OS), run the example with:

java -cp scala-library.jar:CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCATS.jar CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCATS < example.cats

On Windows, using the CMD shell, use:

java -cp scala-library.jar;CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCATS.jar CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCATS < example.cats

The path separator (";" instead of ":") is the only difference.

I do not currently know how to get this job done using the Windows
PowerShell; if you do, I'd appreciate if you let me know via
