This is a command-line program that runs best from the directory in
which this README file is located, i.e. the directory into which you
have unzipped the demo archive.

The following instructions apply to the case that you downloaded an
archive containing files named example.cab and ...CAB.jar.  If you see
example.cats and ...CATS.jar instead; please modify the subsequent
command lines accordingly.

On Unix-like systems (Linux, Mac OS), run the example with:

java -cp scala-library.jar:CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCAB.jar CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCAB < example.cab

The program accepts other input, too; have a look into example.cab to
understand the input format.

On Windows, using the CMD shell, use:

java -cp scala-library.jar;CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCAB.jar CombinatorialVickreyAuctionCAB < example.cab

The path separator (";" instead of ":") is the only difference.

I do not currently know how to get this job done using the Windows
PowerShell; if you do, I'd appreciate if you let me know via
