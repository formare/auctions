Title:
VCG - Combinatorial Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Auctions

Entry name:
VCG

Abstract:

An auction mechanism is mathematically represented
through a pair of functions (a, p): the first describes how
some given goods at stake are allocated among the bidders
(also called participants or agents), while the second spec-
ifies how much each bidder pays following this allocation.
Each possible output of this pair of functions is referred to
as an outcome of the auction. Both functions take the same
argument, which is another function, commonly called a
bid vector b; it describes how much each bidder values the
possible outcomes of the auction. This valuation is usually
expressed through money.
In this setting, some common questions are the study of
the quantitative and qualitative properties of a given auc-
tion mechanism (e.g., whether it maximizes some relevant
quantity, such as revenue, or whether it is efficient, that is,
whether it allocates the item to the bidder who values it
most), and the study of the algorithms running it (in partic-
ular, their correctness).

A VCG auction (named after their inventors Vickrey, Clarke, and
Groves) is a generalization of the single-good, second price Vickrey
auction to the case of a combinatorial auction (multiple goods, from
which any participant can bid on each possible combination). We
formalize in this entry VCG auctions, including tie-breaking and prove
that the function a and p are well-defined. Furthermore we show that a
allocates goods only to participants, only goods in the auction are
allocated, and no good is allocated twice. Furthermore we show that
the price function p is non-negative. These properties also hold for
the automatically extracted Scala.

Topic [see http://afp.sf.net/topics.shtml]:
None of the listed topics really fits well. Closest would come "Set
theory" and "Social choice". A fitting new topic would be "Auctions",
or more generally, "Economics"
