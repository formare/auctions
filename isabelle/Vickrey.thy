section{* Introduction *}

text{*
In second price (or Vickrey) auctions, bidders submit sealed bids;
the highest bidder wins, and pays the highest bid of the \emph{remaining} bids; the losers pay nothing.
(See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction} for more information, including a discussion of variants used by eBay, Google and Yahoo!.)
Vickrey proved that `truth-telling' (i.e. submitting a bid equal to one's actual valuation of the good) was a weakly dominant strategy.
This means that no bidder could do strictly better by bidding above or below its valuation \emph{whatever} the other bidders did.
Thus, the auction is also efficient, awarding the item to the bidder with the highest valuation.

Vickrey was awarded Economics' Nobel prize in 1996 for his work.
High level versions of his theorem, and 12 others, were collected in Eric Maskin's 2004 review of Paul Milgrom's influential book on auction theory
("The unity of auction theory: Milgrom's master class", Journal of Economic Literature, 42(4), pp. 1102â€“1115).
Maskin himself won the Nobel in 2007.

section{* Maximum and related functions *}
text{*
The maximum component value of a vector y of non-negative reals is equal to the value of one of the components, and it is greater or equal than the values of all [other] components.

We implement this as a computable function, whereas in Theorema we had two axioms:
1. The maximum component value is equal to the value of one of the components
2. maximum\_is\_greater\_or\_equal

Here, we derive those two statements as lemmas from the definition of the computable function.

Having the maximum as a computable function might turn out to be useful when doing concrete auctions.
