section{* Introduction *}

text{*
In second price (or Vickrey) auctions, bidders submit sealed bids;
the highest bidder wins, and pays the highest bid of the \emph{remaining} bids; the losers pay nothing.
(See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction} for more information, including a discussion of variants used by eBay, Google and Yahoo!.)
Vickrey proved that `truth-telling' (i.e. submitting a bid equal to one's actual valuation of the good) was a weakly dominant strategy.
This means that no bidder could do strictly better by bidding above or below its valuation \emph{whatever} the other bidders did.
Thus, the auction is also efficient, awarding the item to the bidder with the highest valuation.

Vickrey was awarded Economics' Nobel prize in 1996 for his work.
High level versions of his theorem, and 12 others, were collected in Eric Maskin's 2004 review of Paul Milgrom's influential book on auction theory
("The unity of auction theory: Milgrom's master class", Journal of Economic Literature, 42(4), pp. 1102â€“1115).
Maskin himself won the Nobel in 2007.

section{* Preliminaries *}

text{* some types defined for our convenience *}
type_synonym bool_vector = "nat \<Rightarrow> bool"
  (* TODO CL: report jEdit bug that suggested completions for nat (\<nat>) and bool (\<bool>) cause syntax errors *)
type_synonym real_vector = "nat \<Rightarrow> real"
type_synonym participant = "nat"  (* ordinal number *)
type_synonym participants = "nat" (* cardinal number *)

text{* TODO CL: discuss whether it's intuitive to name some types as in the following lines.
However, being of one such type does not yet imply well-formedness; e.g. we could have an x::allocation, which, for some given n and b does not satisfy "allocation n b x". *}
type_synonym allocation = "real_vector \<Rightarrow> participants \<Rightarrow> bool"
type_synonym payments = "real_vector \<Rightarrow> participants \<Rightarrow> real" (* a payment vector is a function of a real_vector of bids *)

subsection{* some range checks for vectors *}

text{* To ease writing, we introduce a predicate for the range of participants. *}
definition in_range ::
  "nat \<Rightarrow> nat \<Rightarrow> bool" where
  "in_range n i \<equiv> 1 \<le> i \<and> i \<le> n"

text{* we could also, in a higher-order style, generally define a vector whose components satisfy a predicate, and then parameterise this predicate with $\geq 0$ and $> 0$ *}
definition non_negative_real_vector ::
  "nat \<Rightarrow> real_vector \<Rightarrow> bool" where
  "non_negative_real_vector n v \<equiv> \<forall> i::nat . in_range n i \<longrightarrow> v i \<ge> 0"

definition positive_real_vector ::
  "nat \<Rightarrow> real_vector \<Rightarrow> bool" where
  "positive_real_vector n v \<equiv> \<forall> i::nat . in_range n i \<longrightarrow> v i > 0"

section{* Deviation from a vector *}

text{* We define a function that modifies a vector by using an alternative value for a given component. *}
definition deviation ::
  "nat \<Rightarrow> real_vector \<Rightarrow> real \<Rightarrow> nat \<Rightarrow> nat \<Rightarrow> real" where
  "deviation n bid alternative_value index j \<equiv> if j = index then alternative_value else bid j"

text{* We define a function that,
  given one vector and an alternative one (in practice these will be strategy profiles), and a participant index i,
  returns a vector that
  has component i changed to the alternative value (i.e. in practice: the bid of participant i changed), whereas the others keep their original values.

  Actually this definition doesn't check whether its arguments are non-negative real vectors (i.e. well-formed strategy profiles). *}
(* NOTE CL: I changed the order of arguments compared to our original Theorema attempts, as I think this one is more intuitive.
   TODO CL: ask whether there a way of writing the alternative as b_hat, as it looks in the paper version?
   TODO CL: discuss whether there any useful way we could use n for range-checking?  Or don't we need n at all? *)
definition deviation_vec ::
  "nat \<Rightarrow> real_vector \<Rightarrow> real_vector \<Rightarrow> nat \<Rightarrow> nat \<Rightarrow> real" where
  "deviation_vec n bid alternative_vec index \<equiv> deviation n bid (alternative_vec index) index"
  (* the old component-wise definition had an error actually:
     "deviation_vec n bid alternative_vec index j \<equiv> deviation n bid (alternative_vec j) index j"
                                                                                     ^^ should have been index
     so actually a component-wise definition was not necessary
     the error didn't cause trouble because of the "j = index" condition in deviation_def,
     but it prevented us from rewriting deviation_def into deviation without providing a component index, i.e. in curried form.
     The latter was desired after introducing remaining_maximum_invariant
       (which uses the more general "deviation" form instead of "deviation_vec") *)

section{* Strategy (bids) *}
text{*
Strategy and strategy profile (the vector of the strategies of all participants) are not fully defined below. We ignore the distribu-
tion and density function, as they do not play a role in the proof of the theorem.
So, for now, we do not model the random mapping from a participant's valuation to its bid, but simply consider its bid as a non-
negative number that doesn't depend on anything.

The maximum component value of a vector y of non-negative reals is equal to the value of one of the components, and it is greater or equal than the values of all [other] components.

1. The maximum component value is equal to the value of one of the components
2. maximum\_is\_greater\_or\_equal

Here, we derive those two statements as lemmas from the definition of the computable function.

Having the maximum as a computable function might turn out to be useful when doing concrete auctions.
