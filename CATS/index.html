<h1>Combinatorial Auction Test Suite (CATS)</h1>
The Combinatorial Auction Test Suite is a generator of combinatorial auction instances for the testing of CA algorithms.  It features five
distributions of instances from realistic, economically motivated domains, as well as a collection of artificial distributions that have been used in the literature.  Since the release of CATS 1.0 in 2000, it has become a standard benchmark for the evaluation and comparison of CA algorithms.

<h4>What's up with dummy goods? <span class="style1">A number of people have 
emailed me over the years to ask how dummy goods work; this evidently needs to 
be cleared up. These are goods that aren't really sold in the auction, but that 
are added by CATS to enforce additional XOR constraints (specifically, that one 
bidder can't win more than one of his bids). Thus, when you ask CATS to generate 
an auction with 20 goods, you'll see higher-numbered goods in some of the bids; 
these are the dummy goods. The number of dummy goods are given in the header at 
the top of the file. You can learn more about them on page 99 of my
<a href="thesis.pdf">thesis</a>. <strong>
Dummy goods can also be used to tell which agent each bid comes from. </strong>
Every bid that includes the same dummy good comes from the same bidder. Every 
bid without any dummy goods is a unique bid from a different bidder. Thus, you 
can use CATS to model agents' valuations in a combinatorial auction, as well as 
for generating input for winner determination algorithms.</span></h4>
<h4>Current Version: 2.0</h4>

<p>

Major enhancements over version 1.0:</p>
<ul><li>the ability to generate much harder instances<li>a revised, more realistic and more efficient "paths" generator<li>the capacity to create hybrid distributions (distributions over generators) and to sample randomly from a distribution's parameters<li>the capacity to create custom distributions that emphasize certain qualities of the built-in distributions (as we did for hardness; this feature could also be used to select instances that score highly on a custom "realism" metric, for example)<li>the ability to generate a specified number of "non-dominated" bids<li>output in CATS and CPLEX formats<li>the inclusion of all distributions into a single executable, with a flexible and easy-to-use interface</ul>
