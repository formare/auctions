<p>The Combinatorial Auction Test Suite (CATS) was designed to answer a growing
need in the academic community: testing, benchmarking and comparing algorithms
for solving the combinatorial auction winner determination problem.&nbsp; For
details about the combinatorial auction winner determination problem,

<p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
General combinatorial auctions---auctions in which bidders place unrestricted
bids for bundles of goods---are the subject of increasing study. Much of this
work has focused on algorithms for finding an optimal or approximately optimal
set of winning bids. Comparatively little attention has been paid to methodical
evaluation and comparison of these algorithms. In particular, there has not been
a systematic discussion of appropriate data sets that can serve as universally
accepted and well-motivated benchmarks. We propose a suite of distribution
families for generating realistic, economically motivated combinatorial bids in
five broad real-world domains. We hope that this work will yield many comments,
criticisms and extensions, bringing the community closer to a universal
combinatorial auction test suite.</p>

<p><b><u><a name="2.  Contents of this distribution">2.&nbsp; Contents of this
distribution</a></u></b></p>
<p>This distribution of CATS includes a single executable that can be used to
generate from all five distributions described in
sections 4.1-4.5 of the original CATS paper.</p>
<p><b>Paths</b> is essentially as described in
section 4.1 <i>Paths in Space.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; The paths distribution has been
modified to address two problems that would occur in the original: a significant
number of goods (10-30%) would not be part of any bid, and there would often be
single bids or groups of bids that did not share any goods with the
others.&nbsp; These situations should not occur in CATS 2.0-- every good occurs
in at least one bid, and the bid conflict graph (a graph with a node for every
bid and an edge connecting bids that share some good) is guaranteed to be
connected.</p>
<p><b>Regions</b> is described in
section 4.2 <i>Proximity in Space.&nbsp; </i>
The current version mirrors the one described in the paper with the
following corrections:</p>

<ul>

<li> In the bid generation routine, we make bids on DISTINCT bundles.  
That is, we make XOR bids on all B_i such that two copies of the same bid
do not appear.

<li> The routine Add_Good_To_Bundle now first checks to see if the bundle
is already full and, if so, it does nothing.

<li> On the line for bid generation which contains "For each good, reset
p(g) = rand(-deviation * max_good_value, deviation + max_good_value)"
there is the typeo.  The plus should be another star.  That is, the line
should read, "For each good, reset p(g) = rand(-deviation *
max_good_value, deviation * max_good_value)"

<li> In the graph generation routine, we use floor(sqrt(num_goods)) rather
than the ceiling.

</ul>

The following clarifications should be made regarding the distribution:

<ul>

<li> In the bid generation routine, the phrase "if value(B) <= 0 on B,
restart ..." is redundant.  We simply mean, "if value(B) <= 0,
restart ..."

<li> In the bid generation routine, notice we generate a bid on B before
beginning to search for substitutable bids.  If you read the algorithm
closely, you notice that we can actually generate MAX_SUBSTITUTABLE_BIDS+1
XORed bids.  After all, we bid on B, then we generate at most
MAX_SUBSTITUTABLE_BIDS addition XORed bids.

</ul>

<p><b>Arbitrary</b> is described in
section 4.3 <i>Arbitrary Relationships</i>.&nbsp; This distribution relies on
much of the same code as &quot;regions&quot; in exactly the way described in
the paper.  Notice, however, the corrections and clarifications to the 
regions bid generation program, described above.</p>

<p><b>Matching</b> is described in
section 4.4 <i>Temporal Matching</i>.&nbsp; The current version mirrors
the one described in the paper with the following corrections:</p>

<ul>
<li> Now use max(LONGEST_FLIGHT_TIME, num_times) whereever
LONGEST_FLIGHT_TIME appears.  This corrects against problems that can
appear if flight time required is actually more time than is for sale.
</ul>

<p><b>Scheduling</b> is described in section 4.5 <i>Temporal Scheduling</i>.&nbsp; The current
version mirrors exactly the one described in the paper.</p>

<p><b>Legacy</b> distributions L1 through L8 as described in the paper are also
available.&nbsp; Due to the difficulty in generating large numbers of
non-dominated bids with L1 and L5, a warning message will be shown if they are
used.</p>

Running CATS with the &quot;<font face="Courier New">-cats2cplex</font>&quot;
flag followed by input and output filenames will run the built-in file
converter.

<p><b><u><a name="3.  Compiling and executing">3.&nbsp; Compiling and
executing</a></u></b></p> <p>We have compiled and tested these algorithms
on Sun/Solaris, Linux and Windows XP using g++.&nbsp; You will probably have to edit the Makefile to get CATS to compile on your
system.  If there are compilation problems, check the library and include directories in the Makefile.  The current Makefile is configured to
compile in Linux.  To solve linear programming problems, CATS uses a free library called lp_solve
4.0 by default, which is included with the distribution.  If you have access to CPLEX 8.0, we strongly recommend
using it in place of lp_solve 4.0.  This requires only changing the comments in the Makefile (more precise instructions are in the
Makefile).&nbsp; To compile on UNIX, also remove the <font face="Courier New">-DLINUX</font> flags.  To compile on
Windows systems, replace the <font face="Courier New">-DLINUX</font> flags with <font face="Courier New">-DWIN32</font>.&nbsp;
Also, to compile
under other systems, the following changes will (probably) need to be
made:</p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Courier New">srand48()</font> should be replaced with the
    local system's routine to seed the random number generator with an unsigned
    long integer.&nbsp; All the current
    programs seed the random number generator with a call to the system clock.</li>
  <li><font face="Courier New">drand48()</font> should be replaced with the
    local system's routine to generate a random real number between 0 and
    1.</li>
  <li><font face="Courier New">lrand48()</font> should be replaced with the
    local system's routine to generate a non-negative long integer.</li>
</ul>


<p><u><b><a name="4.  File Formats">4.&nbsp; File Formats</a></b></u></p>
<p>Each program in this suite outputs a file with the following format:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">% comments</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">...</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New">goods &lt;NUMBER OF GOODS&gt;<br>
bids &lt;NUMBER OF BIDS&gt;<br>
0&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;content of bid 0&gt;<br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;content of bid 1&gt;<br>
...<br>
&lt;NUMBER OF BIDS-2&gt;&nbsp; &lt;content of bid NUMBER OF BIDS - 2&gt;<br>
&lt;NUMBER OF BIDS-1&gt;&nbsp; &lt;content of bid NUMBER OF BIDS - 1&gt;</font></p>
<p>where <font face="Courier New">&lt;content of bid i&gt;</font> (i between 0
and NUMBER OF BIDS-1, inclusive) represents:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">&lt;real number representing price&gt;&nbsp;
&lt;good i requested&gt;&nbsp; &lt;good j requested&gt;&nbsp; ... &lt;good k
requested&gt;&nbsp; #</font></p>
<p>where each good number is between 0 and NUMBER OF GOODS-1</p>
<p>Informally, the file format is: any number of comment lines beginning with
percent sign, the word &quot;goods&quot; followed by the total number of
goods,&nbsp;on the next line, the word &quot;bids&quot; followed by the
total number of bids.&nbsp; Then each following line is the bid number, followed
by the price, followed by each good-number requested, all terminated by a pound
sign.&nbsp; Each line that represents a bid is tab-delimited.</p>
<p>It is also possible to output in CPLEX format (in addition to CATS format)
with the <font face="Courier New">-cplex</font> flag, and to convert from CATS
to CPLEX using the <font face="Courier New">-cats2cplex</font> flag.</p>
<p>Most distributions included in this test suite generate real valued
prices.&nbsp; Should you wish to test on a combinatorial auction solver that
only takes integer valued prices (e.g., modeling an auction with a bidding
increment), you can add the <font face="Courier New">-int_prices</font> flag to
the command line.  &nbsp; Note that this constant factor
by which you multiply through must
be significant -- for instance, if you rescale the prices to integers
between 0 and
5, the difficulty of the problem may change.&nbsp; The default factor is 1000;
you can change it using the <font face="Courier New">-bid_alpha</font> flag
followed by the new factor.&nbsp; If you publicize results of
your algorithm on the distribution, be sure to mention what factor you used! :-)</p>
